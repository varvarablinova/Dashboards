# Dashboard based on a sociological survey
This dashboard is based on the results of an anonymous survey on the topic "Does education affect career success?" The purpose of the survey is to check the following hypotheses:

1. As the level of education rises, there are more guarantees of success in a career;

2. Also, the level of education influences satisfaction with income;

3. Diploma marks are not important to take a leadership position or become an entrepreneur.

The survey was created on the Google Forms platform. Respondents are asked to answer a number of questions:

1. Indicate the level of education, average grades in the diploma, professional field and age;

2. Subjectively assess satisfaction with career and income on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 - completely dissatisfied, 5 - completely satisfied;

3. Answer the question whether education helps in career path.

Respondents' responses are collected in Google Sheets. Because a direct table connection was configured in Power BI, the dashboard is been automatically updated when new answers are appeared.

The main difficulty that I had to face was related to the questions of where there might be an open answer. To normalize the data, reference books were created: the first column contains all possible answers of the respondents, the second column contains the data necessary for analysis, which is entered manually. It was not possible to fully automate the process, since the answers of the respondents are not predictable.

As for its structure, the dashboard is divided into two pages. The first is the cover with the main conclusion, the second is the main one, contains all the diagrams, there is a button to go to the survey in the upper right corner.

The following conclusions were made based on the results of the research:

1. On average, only a third of the respondents answered unequivocally "yes" about the usefulness of education in their career path;

2. The higher the level of education, the higher the part of those who answered affirmatively about the usefulness of education. A similar trend can be traced in the context of age groups: the older the respondents, the higher they rate the usefulness of education;

3. The higher the level of education, the higher, on average, the satisfaction with career and income;

4. In terms of age groups, there is no clear pattern regarding satisfaction with career and income. However, there is a clear decline in career and income satisfaction among the 30-40 age group. The highest satisfaction scores are among respondents aged 40 to 50;

5. Overall, career success scores are higher than income satisfaction scores. This means that income is not the determining factor for recognizing a career successful;

6. As expected, the largest number of respondents with an average mark in the diploma is "satisfactorily" among entrepreneurs;

7. The respondents who received the "satisfactorily" grade rated the usefulness of education higher than those who received the "good" grade.
